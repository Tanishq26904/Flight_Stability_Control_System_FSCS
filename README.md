# Flight_Stability_Control_System_FSCS
A Flight Stability Control System (FSCS) is an advanced technology used in aircraft to enhance stability and control during flight. It automatically adjusts control surfaces such as ailerons, elevators, and rudders in real-time to maintain steady flight conditions, compensate for turbulence, and respond to pilot inputs with precision. The system uses sensors to monitor the aircraft's attitude, speed, and other critical parameters, making continuous micro-adjustments to ensure smooth and safe operation. FSCS is essential for improving the handling characteristics of both manned and unmanned aircraft, particularly in challenging weather conditions or during complex maneuvers.
