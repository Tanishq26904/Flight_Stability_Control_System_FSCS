# Flight Stability and Control System (FSCS) 

## Introduction

The Flight Stability and Control System (FSCS) is a fundamental concept in aerospace engineering, ensuring that an aircraft remains stable during flight and responds predictably to pilot inputs or environmental disturbances. In an Arduino-based FSCS project, the goal is to design a basic flight control system capable of maintaining stability in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), such as a drone or model aircraft, using sensors and actuators controlled by the Arduino microcontroller.

This project typically involves integrating sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers (commonly found in an MPU6050 or similar Inertial Measurement Unit) to detect the aircraft's orientation and motion. The Arduino processes this data to assess the current stability, while flight control algorithms—such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control—are used to adjust control surfaces (e.g., rudder, elevators, ailerons) or motors in drones. By continuously monitoring sensor feedback and adjusting controls, the system can maintain level flight, correct for external disturbances like wind, and improve maneuverability.

The FSCS Arduino project offers a practical introduction to aviation concepts such as pitch, roll, and yaw control, while showcasing how electronic systems are used to automate flight stability. Additionally, it provides hands-on experience in integrating hardware (sensors, servos, or motors), coding real-time control algorithms, and understanding the principles of dynamic stability.

## MPU6050 
The MPU6050 is a widely used 6-axis motion tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on a single chip. This sensor provides real-time data on both angular velocity (from the gyroscope) and linear acceleration (from the accelerometer), making it ideal for applications that require precise motion sensing and orientation tracking. It is extensively used in projects involving robotics, drones, gaming controllers, and wearable devices due to its accuracy, compact size, and ease of integration with microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

The MPU6050 communicates via the I²C protocol, which allows it to connect easily to most microcontrollers with just two data lines, SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). In addition to motion data, the MPU6050 features a built-in Digital Motion Processor (DMP), which can perform complex calculations like sensor fusion, eliminating the need for additional processing by the microcontroller. This enables the sensor to output more accurate orientation data, combining both accelerometer and gyroscope readings to track motion even in challenging conditions where individual sensors may be less effective.

In projects involving flight stabilization (e.g., drones) or robotics, the MPU6050 plays a key role in maintaining balance and controlling movement, by continuously feeding real-time data to the control system. Its versatility and ease of use make it a preferred choice for motion-sensing applications in both beginner and advanced electronics projects.
